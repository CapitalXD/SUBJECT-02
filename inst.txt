Welcome to Subject02!
This game is a classic text-based
game. No images, just words to 
guide you through your quest. 
Subject02 is about you, a teenage boy
and your adventures trying to escape
from a top-secret scientific research
facility.

In Subject02 you will be placed
in all sorts of different situations. 
To act, you must type commands, such
as 'Dig' or 'Swim'. If your command 
is mis-spelled, or not an available
option, you will see an error message
appear on your screen - e.g. "<command>
is not an available option." Or "you
can't select <command> now. Please try
again." Commands are not case-sensitive.

At any time during the course of the game,
you may type , "H", and a list of possible
(but not all) commands will be shown. This
is a last-resort, and is suggested to only
be used when you have been stuck for an
extended period of time.
